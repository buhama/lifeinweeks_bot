# lifeinweeks_bot
Extremely morbid responsive Twitter bot, visualizing usersâ€™  life on an infographic.

The search bot function is commented out because it will cause the bot to be flagged for spam by Twitter and shut the bot down.

The bot responds to tweets with the date format yyyy-mm-dd and with a mention of the bots uersname. The infographic is inspired by the one at waitbutwhy.com.
